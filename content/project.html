          <h1>METRO NEKO</h1>
          <br><br><br>
          <h1>Overview</h1>
        <article>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Topic</h3>
          <br>
            <p>
              Our project proposal is to design a 2D-side scroller game so that it can be compatible on both iOS and Android mobile operating systems. We want to make the project simple and easy to understand yet challenging enough to keep the player
              engaged. The player must complete each level in the most time efficient way, while collecting coins and avoiding depleting health levels. Successful players receive higher bonus points on the scoreboard.
            </p>
            <br>
          <p>
            We imagine the game aesthetics to have a dark theme. Set in a dystopian futuristic city, backed by a neon skyline backdrop, our main character (a cat) will have to maneuver its way through the city – jumping from platform to platform,
            avoiding various obstacles and enemies along the way. The music will complement the overall gloomy vibe, with eerie techno music accompanying the players’ gameplay experience. We hope to complete at least Level 1, to serve as the basis
            for future iterations and to provide an expectation the skills required by the player to succeed as the game continues to the next levels. We hope the players will experience it as an homage to old-school gaming culture in a
            romanticised 2D world.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Our project is focused on meeting current market demands. Statistically, 81% of gamers play on mobile devices, with puzzle/platform games the second-most popular genre after simulation games (GWI 2021). Side-scrolling games have been
            popular since the eighties and remain so: of the top 100 ranked games on the Apple App Store, 50 are 2-D titles. Side-scrolling platformers are a style of game everyone can enjoy, regardless of age or ability, and thus have remained
            popular despite advances in technology. The top reasons for playing games include for enjoyment, storylines and escaping from reality (GWI 2021); as such, with its interesting narrative and simple controls, our game will appeal to a
            broad range of gamers. By completing this project, we would be able to demonstrate to future employers our experience in all stages of developing a commercially viable product, including conceptualisation, market research, planning,
            programming and editing.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Landscape</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            While many side-scrolling platformers already exist, the huge demand for mobile games means enthusiasts are constantly seeking fresh new experiences. Among the most popular titles are Super Mario Run, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Rayman
            Jungle Run. What separates our product from these types of games is a more mature aesthetic and narrative, which will attract adult gamers; having said this, with its simple controls and appealing main character, our game will still be
            accessible for all types of gamers. The main frustrations consumers have reported regarding their gaming experiences are games that do not run smoothly, are too expensive to progress in, or too hard to play. Our product promises to
            provide consistently high framerates, will not require in-app purchases, and will be challenging enough to engage players without the need to master a difficult set of controls.

          <h1>Aims</h1>
          <br>
          <article>
            <p>
              In this project, we aim to develop the first level of our game as a proof-of-concept. The game will support a widescreen 16:9 ratio, and the characters and certain objects will be animated. It will also include sound effects
              corresponding to the playable character and enemies’ actions, and theme music. In terms of programming, the C# script will implement simple 2D physics to simulate gravity and allow the user to control the playable character. A list of specific goals for each of these categories follows:
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Static Visuals and Animations</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              To engage players, our game needs to include an aesthetically pleasing environment, and interesting animations. We will create original artwork for the background, which will scroll at a different aspect to the character and other
              objects to simulate depth. Animations will be developed for the main character’s motions, including running, jumping, falling and dying, as well as for the movement of enemies and the rotation of coins.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Sound Effects</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              To create atmosphere and act as feedback to players, our game should have sound effects that correspond to the action of the scene. Original theme music will be composed, of approximately one minute in length; this will loop as the user
              plays. Short tunes will also be required to signal a player’s achievements at the completion of the level. We will create individual sounds for the enemies, and for the playable character for instances of falling off a platform,
              touching an enemy, collecting coins, and completing the game. All sounds will be in stereo.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              The main character must respond the player’s inputs, and the game itself needs to possess realistic physics to support interaction between the main character and the environment.  The main character must be able to move left and right,
              and jump. Enemies should begin moving left and right once they are visible. The main character should fall if not standing on a platform, while the coins need to remain suspended in the air until collected. At the end of the level, the
              player’s time and score will be written to a locally stored XML file.

            <p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are we building?</h3>
            <br>
            Code Cats are developing a single player, 2D action platformer game titled Metro Neko. With its side-scroller dynamic, Metro Neko will be easy to understand whilst its increasingly challenging gameplay, unique characters and vibrant
            atmosphere will keep players engaged.

            <p>
              <h3>Who is our target audience?</h3>
              <br>
              According to WePC, there are 2.7 billion gamers globally (WEPC 2021). Of this, Asia-Pacific accounts for 49.2%, North America at 25.1%, Europe at 18.6%, Latin America at 3.8% and the Middle East & Africa at 3.4% (WEPC 2021). Taking this
              into account, along with the average age of gamers being 33 (GWI 2021), Metro Neko’s target audience will be consumers aged 18-34, marketed towards those in Asia-Pacific and North America.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <h3>Competition:</h3>
              <br>
              Metro Neko’s competition is mostly mobile games. Google Play Store and Apple App store are the main targets of the game. We mainly focus on user interface, and we are making the game more user friendly while keeping the promotions and
              ads to help with finding the right audience. We are also looking to use platforms that boost ranking of Metro Neko in Google Play Store ranking. Lastly, we will be creating a website to accompany the game to introduce it to more people
              across the web.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <h3>Which platform/s will it be on?</h3>
              <br>
              With multi-device ownership not being uncommon in today’s age, 81% of consumers play games on their smartphones and tablets whilst 65% play games on their PC/laptops (GWI 2021). In order for Metro Neko to reach as many players as
              possible, it will be made available across multiple platforms, first being introduced on mobile devices (Android and iOS) with further development necessary before being made available on PC.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <h3>Key features</h3>
              <br>
            <p>GWI states that 70% of gamers play games for one main reason, it is fun. Of that 70%, 50% are more likely to stop playing a game because they either lose interest or the game did not meet their expectations (GWI 2021). Metro Neko’s key
              features have been designed with consumer engagement at the forefront. Features include:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>A unique main character</li>
              <li>A defined nemesis</li>
              <li>Enemies to destroy</li>
              <li>Objects/points to collect</li>
              <li>Vibrant world/environment</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <h3>Who are the characters?</h3>
              <br>
            <p>With over 373 million cats kept as pets world-wide (WORLDATLAS 2020), it is obvious that people love cats. Our team at Code Cats is no exception to that statistic and so Metro Neko was developed as a result of our shared love of cats
              and animals in general in mind. Metro Neko will feature several cat-based characters, including:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Senshi</b> - Our hero and the games playable character</li>
              <li><b>Miyako</b> - Senshi’s nemesis and overall game villain</li>
              <li><b>White Ghost Cats</b> - In-game enemy/obstacle that cannot be destroyed</li>
              <li><b>Zombie Cats</b> - In-game enemy/obstacle that can be destroyed</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <h3>When and where does it take place? </h3>
              <br>
              Metro Neko will take place in a city of the same name, in a dystopian-type future where all citizens are cats. The streets of Metro Neko are dark and ominous with vibrant pops of neon colours.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Pre-Production</h2>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Story Outline </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to the City of Metro Neko where life is murky and dreadful. A city where crime is soaring with Miyako being the most vicious criminal of the city aggravating the cat’s life. She runs heaps of gangs across the city. Frightening
              cats, killing cats and selling drugs are among some of the illegal acts she does. She is an unstoppable criminal, even though the Metro Neko Police department (MNPD) has arrested her so many times she can run away from the hold in no
              time. She even works with corrupt governors (Metro Neko Government) of the city. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Senshi is the city’s saviour, he is the hero of the cats, he has been working alongside the MNPD arresting outrageous criminals and gangs and putting them behind the bars. Senshi’s rivalry Miyako is the agitator, making the Metro Neko
              a horrible place to live for cats, while this has been going on for a while Senshi is confident that he is going to put a stop to that once and for all. He is convinced that this is the last time Miyako is disturbing the city and he can
              bring peace to the city of Metro Neko. </p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>Character Description: </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Protagonist:</h3>
            <br>
            <p><b>Name</b>: Senshi<p>
            <p>Senshi is a hero from Metro Neko. He is famous for his exceptional sword play abilities. He is well known to locate and catch criminals and put them behind the bars. He is a special and well-respected citizen of the Metro City. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Antagonist: </h3>
            <br>
            <p><b>Name</b>: Miyako<p>
            <p>Miyako is a vile criminal from Metro Neko. She is the leader of many dangerous gangs in the city. She is known for being the most dangerous criminal by Metro Neko Police Department. She has exceptional sword play abilities and she is
              very fast and nimble when it comes to running away from sticky situations. </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p><b>Type</b>: Ghost Cat </p>
            <p>Ghost cats awaken from the graves of the City of Metro Neko. Being killed innocently by the criminals of the city they are full of hate and anger. They roam around relentlessly and can’t be killed. Beware and always avoid them, they
              are already dead. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Type</b>: Zombie Cat </p>
            <p>Brainless and agile, they can run after their pray, eat their brains and turn them into Zombie cats as well. They are part of an experimental disaster ran by the corrupt governor of the city. Although they can be killed, you need to be
              very cautious in doing so as they are fast. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Technological Capabilities/Constraints
              Early Prototyping</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In order for our team to fully assess the validity of the design of our game and uncover any potential practical issues, we committed to completing a 1 level prototype of the game. From this early protype we can analyse four main
              components of our games design, structure and capabilities. These components include:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Representation </li>
              <li>Precision</li>
              <li>Interactivity </li>
              <li>Evolution</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>This prototype will work as the basis for all testing and feature implementation.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Production </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Design </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Character design: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>All characters in Metro Neko are based on different types of cats. In order to avoid our characters looking too similar, we ensured that each one had their own unique distinguishable features. </p>
            <br><br>

            <br>
            <h3>Background: </h3>
            <p>The level backgrounds of Metro Neko are an interpretation of a city skyline at night. We wanted to keep the basis of the shapes indicative of this type of scape but also implement a dystopian and futuristic/abstract style to them. Pops
              of Neon colour were also added to emphasise the futuristic feel of the overall level as well as compliment the level platforms and animations </p>

            <h3>Platforms: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>When designing the in-game platforms, we wanted to ensure that they had the look and the feel of city streets whilst still keeping to our dystopian/futuristic theme. Taking inspiration from the bright and busy streets of Tokyo, we
              included a number of animations on the platforms, as well as included the bright neon colours from the background to complete the look. </p>

            <h3>Interactive Design Features: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>The gameplay consists of multiple basic interactive design elements. This includes: </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Words</b>: Providing users with gameplay tutorial information that is clear and easy to understand, also allowing them to re-read and access the information from the main menu in case they have dismissed them by accident. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Audio visuals</b>: Users are also allowed to interact with the game using videos, soundtracks, images, typography, the user interface and of course the gameplay. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Time</b>: The game consists of levels and a progression system. Each level gets harder and more challenging which takes longer to progress and more rewarding as the player progresses through each level. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>User interface interactions:</h3>
            <br>
            <p><b>Trailer</b>: The user is presented with a short 10-15 second video outlining the story and introducing the main character as well as the protagonist. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Menu</b>: The user is then presented with the main menu of the game, this includes the logo and the name of the game, the soundtrack of the game as well as the start menu. The menu consists of “Play”, “Tutorials” and “Exit”. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Story</b>: Upon starting the game for the first time, there is a longer video expanding on the story, using audio visuals and words at the same time. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Gameplay</b>: The game starts presenting the main character and the first level to overcome, the tutorials are interactive in a sense that they will run as necessary in different situations. They will pause the game and let the user read
              and dismiss by clicking/tapping on the display. The second playthrough will not have the tutorials enabled. Health bar and score system also available to the users as visuals. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>User Interface controls: </h3>
            <br>

            <h2>Gameplay </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Object of the game: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>The object of the game is for the player to get to the last level, putting a stop to the evil Miyako, locking her up for good once and for all. To achieve this, players must progress through 10 levels, with the difficulty increasing as
              each level progresses. Across each level, players will need to avoid/destroy enemies whilst collecting coins, which earn them points towards their overall high score. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Gameplay description: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Game play is consisting of jumping, running, health bar and score system: </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Jumping</b>: it allows the player to jump on the platforms, jump over obstacles to avoid enemies and dangers, and to jump on the enemies to kill them. Failing to jump on platforms or hitting obstacles or enemies will result in death and
              game over. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Running</b>: it allows the players to move around the level as well as choosing different paths and platforms. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Health bar</b>: A visual representation of the main characters health. Upon being hit by an enemy the health bar decreases. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Score system</b>: A visual representation of the score achieved by the players.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Game play specifications: </h3>
            <br>
            <p><b>Genre</b>: The genre is an action platformer, and the gameplay is around jumping, running, and overcoming obstacle and enemies along the way to finish each level. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Difficulty</b>: The difficulty of the game increases every time a player fails to complete a level, as a result increasing the number of obstacles and enemies. However, completing a level successfully will increase the difficulty of the
              next level. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Time to complete</b>: The game should take less than 1 hour to complete all 10 levels. To get both endings you would require 2 hours to complete the game. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Level description: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Each level is consisting of a different environment, platforms, obstacles, and enemies: </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Environment</b>: There will be 10 levels and each level represent a different time of the year and season. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Platforms</b>: Platforms will be placed differently across each level, and they will follow the same environmental look and feel. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Obstacles</b>: Obstacles will be placed on the platforms and sometimes under the platforms to add more dangers to each level. </p>
<br>
          <p><b>Enemies</b>: Enemies will roam on the platforms and guarding in tricky to jump situations. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sound design description: </h3>
            <br>
            <p><b>Opening cinematic soundtrack</b>: To include Presto tempo music using 168-200 beats per minute. This is to increase the tension of the fight shown in the cinematic. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Game story soundtrack</b>: To include Larghissimo tempo music using under 24 beats per minute to add more immersive dynamics to the game story. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Main Menu soundtrack</b>: Same music from the Game story soundtrack to continue playing in the main menu. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Level soundtrack</b>: To include Moderato tempo music using 108-120 beats per minute. This is to increase the tension and immersions of players into the environment. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Senshi</b>: To have natural serious human voice, with some characteristics from Cats like, purring and meowing. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Development </h2>
            <br>
            <p>In order to fully realise Metro Neko, our development team utilised a combination of software to design and create the game, these include: </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Unity Version 2019.4.22f1</b> - Unity was used to create game itself. </li>
              <li><b>Adobe Photoshop Version 22.4.1</b> - Photoshop was used to create in-game assets including characters, objects and level backgrounds. </li>
              <li><b>Adobe Illustrator Version 25.2.3</b> - Illustrator was used in addition to Photoshop to assist in the creation of in-game assets. </li>
              <li><b>Adobe Animate Version 21.0.6</b> - Adobe animate was utilised to animate character movement for the game as well as a concept trailer. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>As we are using Unity to develop our game in conjunction with Adobe Creative Cloud software, there are no specific hardware requirements for development as all of those products are available across numerous devices. </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Testing </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Bug Identification </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Unity in-built support allows for direct bug identification and resolution. There are three ways to access this: </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>(1) In the Menu – Help > Report a bug</li>
              <li>(2) Executable through the installed directory </li>
              <li>(3) Executable through the installed directory </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>As per user documentation there are a multitude of reasons for bugs and various ways we can resolve these issues. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Feature Creep </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Software vulnerability will be minimised using UNITY as an effective engine to program our game. </p>
<br>
            <p>UNITY has substantial supporting documentation readily available online as well as a milieu of video tutorials which will guide the implementation of various features, assets and across different formats. </p>
<br>
            <p>As previously noted, feature creep for this project has been assessed as minimal risk based on our members’ technical and creative experiences. The features should be simple, functional and the plan will have no excess or conflicting
              attributes.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Game Engagement </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Game engagement will be tested prior to release. </p>
            <br>
            <p>All members will test version 1 to see if the levels need to more challenging, this will also assess overall user experience and we will ensure we adapt changes based on feedback. Future testing may potentially be tested via a
              randomised selection of external users. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Launch </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Final Testing Stage </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to the initial first release of Metro Neko, our development team will go through final testing phases. This includes testing for any minor/major bugs and fixing or re-designing any necessary elements. Some of the main elements
              that will be focussed on at this stage of testing will be the User Interface, visual range and texture quality as well as any animation improvements. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Version 1 Release </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Version 1 of Metro Neko is released on mobile devices. The release will feature one fully realised level of the game. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Post-Production </h2>
            <br>
            <p>With the game now out on an initial release, the team will focus on maintenance activity. This includes: </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Minor/Major bug correction</b> - The team will monitor reports from players, releasing fixes where necessary. </li>
              <li><b>Patches/Updates</b> - The team will continue to work on developing the game, releasing patches and updates for the further 9 planned levels of the game. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>After the release of a fully completed 10 level game on mobile devices, the team will look into further development of a sequel, dependant on player reviews, as well as the potential for PC release and monetization. </p>

          <h1>Roles</h1>
          <br><br>
          <article>
            <p>A broad range of technical skills and expertise is required to complete this project, of which most team members possess a basic understanding; however, no one is sufficiently proficient in any specific field, meaning we will instead
              need to collaborate with each other across most tasks. Having said this, it is reasonable to assign Arian the role of Lead Developer: the project idea originally came from his first assignment, so he has the best understanding of the
              overall concept, plan and what is required, and is also equipped with experience in developing games and technical skills such as Unity, C# and Microsoft Visual Studio. He will guide and advise the team through the project. With about
              eight years of analyst experience, Eun Mi will be assuming the role of Marketing Manager, in which she will be responsible for conducting market research and investigating the target audience. Other roles such as Technical Designer, 2D
              Artist, User Interface and Experience Designer will be shared by Jake, Chelsea, Ashwin and Yvette, who have useful technical skills and experience, including UI/UX design, Adobe software, and programming languages. They will collaborate
              to work on designing the characters, platform and elements, audio, and visual effects. This arrangement will continue without any changes until the project completion, as it will be difficult for individuals to obtain the relevant
              technical skills in a such a short period.

          <h1>Testing </h1>
          <br>
          <article>
            <br>
            <p>Testing our development will be a repetitive process which each subsequent version being tested extensively for bugs and errors. Professionally, game testing follows a structure regardless of the size and scope of the game developed*.
              With each new version, test documents need to be revisited and edited to adjust specifications and new added features or possible weaknesses. Any new bugs and errors should be subsequently identified. The first step would be to classify
              the user and system requirements – functional, non- functional testing. As the current scope of the project is somewhat limited these categories are not yet extensive. Functional testing involves testing items that are related to the
              user’s requirements and can be manually tested. Non-functional testing conversely refers to items that are related on the user’s expectations and are difficult to perform manually. </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Functional: User-Interface, gameplay, and functionality. </li>
              <li>Non-functional: Security, efficiency, survivability, usability. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Based on these classifications, first, the functional aspects of the game will be tested. This segment of our testing methodology involves extensively testing for feature and bug issues. Manually testing the interface and gameplay as
              each subsequent change and adjustment is made. This phase will extend through the main development of the game. Examples of this testing phase are manually checking colors, background, audio, animations, user interfaces, resolution, and
              gameplay. Unity, the tool we are using to develop Metro Neko offers an extensive debugging tool – MonoDevelop IDE which we will utilize to debug the programming side of our game. As Unity also offers conditional breakpoints at lines,
              this is another technical aspect of our main development tool that will greatly aid in testing. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Once a bare-bones mockup is ready with core functionality and all functional aspects are accounted for, non-functional testing can begin. This segment of our testing strategy will deal with aspects that are harder to test manually such
              as efficiency and user experience, this will require additional users testing our development. This stage might include an open alpha or beta test where we would offer the game to be tested by the public. A small sample size of users at
              this stage would be sufficient i.e., <=100. These users will be found in a few different places – they can be sourced personally (friends and family), Reddit posts on beta test forums, and an email list on our marketing media.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Success in the testing segment of our development will be achieved when no major bugs or vulnerabilities are left on the game, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, and we have a satisfactory user experience reported from our beta tests. As testing is a repetitive and ongoing process as the game is further developed and new features are added testing will continue and these goals will be extended. </p>

          <h1>Group processes and communications</h1>

          <article>
            <br>
            <p>Communications are a key facet of our workflow as a team. We will have two set meetings a week for the duration of our development. The service Microsoft teams is invaluable for this process. In the meetings we go through our work so
              far and resolve any issues. We also use the service Discord as a more informal but regular form of communication. Any minor issues that arise can be discussed and resolved to some degree more expeditiously using text communication in
              Discord. The file service in Microsoft Teams serves as a de-facto version collaboration tool, similar to GitHub for text files and documents where we communicate via the Code Cats discord server or direct messages in discord and make
              changes and edits collaboratively to the documents in Teams. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In the event that a group member is unable to attend meetings or communicate regularly, we will take several steps to attempt to resolve the issue. It is always possible and understandable that issues beyond the control of individual
              members arise, and as a team it is important to come to a compromise that is emphatic and realistic but also productive. In case of a situation like this, the first step would be to have a discussion with said member about the issue.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Once the issue is determined and discussed appropriately, steps can be taken to resolve it - for example reassigning said member to work that is not an immediate priority. Alternatively, current work deadlines can be adjusted or
              extended. If the only issue is communication, the team could require more consistent communication or something more personal like direct messages to make sure work is being done in a timely manner. As long as the member contributes
              equally there are many compromises that can be made. </p>
